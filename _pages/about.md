I am interested in Artificial Intelligence, Communication Networks, Signal Processing and, most recently, Numerical Optimization and Evolutionary Computation. I also have been publishing papers on Power Systems, mostly in Fault Detection on Frequency Domain. Since 2015, I have been an Electrical Engineering undergraduate student at _Universidade de Brasília_, where I have been given the opportunity to hold a lot of Community and Research positions. In 2016, I  was elected to Electrical Engineering Students’ Union, serving a term as Director of Academic Affairs, and then, in 2018, appointed as a Student Member of _Universidade de Brasília_’s Council of Teaching, Research and Extension, representing the interest of my fellow students in academical matters. Also in 2018, I was a founding member of IEEE Computational Intelligence Society Student Chapter at _Universidade de Brasília_, as well as its first (2018-2019) and third (2019-nowadays) Chair, serving as its Secretary General (2019) between my two terms as Chair.

 As an undergraduate, I also have been engaged in Research Activities, being part, as an undergraduate researcher, of the Power System Protection Laboratory (2017-2018), Digital Television and Communication Networks Laboratory (2018-2019), Smart Grids Laboratory (2018-),  Digital Signal Processing Group (2019-) and Spatial Information Systems Laboratory (2019-). For my research activities at _Universidade de Brasília_, I have received the Young Researcher Grant from Fundação Universidade de Brasília between 2017 and 2018, published  4 conference papers and submitted one paper to a journal. Both of My Conference Papers "_Analysis of Fault Location Functions Based on High Frequency Components on Transmission Lines_" and "_On the impact of
Operational Conditions on MUSIC-Based Direction of Arrival Detection Systems_" were awarded with Honorable Mentions, with the first also being Nominated to Best Paper in STEM.

In 2019, I was awarded the prestigious Mitacs Globalink Research Internship Grant, a highly competitive grant that matches outstanding international students with high output Canadian Professors in top Canadian Universities for a Research Internship. As a Computer Science Visiting Student at Dalhousie University, I have worked under the supervision of [Dr. Zincir-Heywood](https://web.cs.dal.ca/~zincir/) and joined the [Network Information Management and Security (NIMS) Group](https://projects.cs.dal.ca/projectx/), exploring applications of Classical Machine Learning and Deep Learning in the context of Insider Threat Detection, publishing one conference paper on the theme.
